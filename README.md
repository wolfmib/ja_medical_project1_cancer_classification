## Introduction

Early and accurate detection of cancer can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project focuses on developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify medical images for cancer detection. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing a tool to automatically identify potential cancerous cells.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Histopathologic Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection)
- **Description**: The dataset consists of labeled histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. Each image is labeled as cancerous or non-cancerous.

**Note**: Please download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Packages** (see `requirements.txt` for full list):
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - torch
  - torchvision
  - jupyter

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ja_medical_project1_cancer_classification.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ja_medical_project1_cancer_classification
   ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate the virtual environment:
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Unix or MacOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
